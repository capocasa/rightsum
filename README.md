# Rightsum

A Chrome extension that summarizes any link with Google Gemini.

Particularly useful for getting a quick TLDR of YouTube videos without having to watch them — just Alt+Click the video link and get a summary in seconds.

## How it works

Rightsum gives you two ways to summarize a link:

- **Alt+Click** any link on any page
- **Right-click** a link and select "Summarize" from the context menu

Either method opens a new Google Gemini tab and automatically submits a "Summarize" prompt with the link URL.

## Install

1. Clone this repo or download the source
2. Open `chrome://extensions/` in Chrome
3. Enable **Developer mode** (top-right toggle)
4. Click **Load unpacked** and select the extension directory
